Classify the types of data exposed (PII or not).
  Passwords – Yes, considered PII, as they give access to user accounts when linked with emails or phone number.
  Messages – Yes, PII, since they can contain personal or sensitive information.
  Location Histories – Yes, PII, as they can reveal an individual’s movements and identity.
So, all three types of data exposed in this case qualify as Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What were likely technical and human errors that caused the breach?
Technical errors-
  1-Weak or outdated encryption of stored passwords or messages.
  2-Poor access controls or misconfigured databases.
  3-Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin or internal accounts.
  4-No proper vulnerability management, allowing exploits via known bugs.
  5-Insecure APIs exposing location data.

Human errors-
  1-Employees falling for phishing attacks.
  2-Mishandling or accidentally exposing sensitive data during testing or deployment.
  3-Inadequate security training or awareness among staff.
  4-Not using Principle of least privilege.

How does this case reflect the broader need for cybersecurity?
This case shows that even large platforms are vulnerable without strong security practices.
Users trust platforms with their personal data—losing that trust damages reputation and invites legal action.
It highlights the need for:
1-End-to-end encryption
2-Regular audits and penetration testing
3-Strong data governance policies
4-Security awareness training
Overall, it proves that cybersecurity isn't optional—it’s a core requirement for any digital service handling personal data.
