What are the cybersecurity principles violated here (CIA Triad)?
All three pillars of CIA triad have been violated as-
  Confidentiality: Patient records are exposed  or could be stolen by attackers. This leads to privacy violation and 
  misuse of medical data of patients.
  Integrity: Medical data could be tampered with or corrupted, risking patient safety.
  Availability: Access to patient records and hospital systems is blocked, halting surgeries and operations.

How could PII and CII be involved in this situation?
PII (Personally Identifiable Information): Patient names, contact info, medical history, Aadhaar numbers, etc., may be 
leaked or misused for identity theft or financial fraud.
CII (Critical Information Infrastructure): Hospital systems that support emergency care, surgeries, and life-saving 
equipment are considered CII since their disruption affects public health and safety making their protection a top 
priority under national cybersecurity policies.

Propose a cybersecurity framework the hospital should adopt going forward.
The hospital should adopt a framework like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) focusing on:
Identify: Map all critical assets and data flows.Understand risks and vulnerabilities.
Protect: Use firewalls, endpoint protection, encryption, and regular access reviews.
Detect: Set up real-time monitoring and alert systems for abnormal behavior.
Respond: Have an incident response plan to quickly contain ransomware attacks.
Recover: Maintain regular offline backups and test disaster recovery procedures.
