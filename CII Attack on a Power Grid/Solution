Why is a power grid classified under CII?
A power grid is considered Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) because it supports essential services like electricity,
healthcare, and communication. If itâ€™s disrupted, it can lead to serious consequences like blackouts, halted emergency services,
and economic loss. It's essential infrastructure, as recognized by India's NCIIPC (National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre).

How do cyber threats to CII differ from threats to general IT systems?
Differences-
  1-Impact:CII attacks can impact public safety; IT attacks mostly affect data and business continuity.
  2-Downtime and loss:Even minor outages in CII can be critical and incurr huge loss for nation, whereas IT systems can tolerate short downtimes and only affects the particular organization.
  3-Security focus:CII focuses on availability and integrity; IT focuses more on confidentiality and access control.
  4-Systems and Infrastructure:CII often involves legacy systems and human-operated interfaces, making it more vulnerable to targeted attacks, whereas IT uses modern and automated systems.
  5-Motivation:CII often targeted by state-sponsored actors for disruption and chaos in nation; IT by criminals for financial gain and defamation.

What steps should be taken to strengthen CII security in this context?
  1-Awareness & Training: Train all staff, especially operational technicians, to spot phishing emails and social engineering attempts.
  2-Email Security: Use advanced email filtering and anti-phishing tools.
  3-Regular Patching & Updates: Fix known vulnerabilities in both IT and OT systems
  4-Simulated Drills: Conduct cyberattack simulations to test readiness
  5-Incident Response Plan: Have a clear recovery strategy in place to react quickly during attacks.
